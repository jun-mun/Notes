# 🧾 Technical Analysis Doc: Imputed Income Update Events

## 📌 Objective
To identify where imputed incomes are calculated and add a step to store the imputed income value in a new column when any of the following events occur:
- Rate Recalculation  
- Renewal  
- Dependent Age Out  
- Employee Aging (Life/Disability)  
- Spouse Aging (Life)

---

## ❓ Questions:
- Any other rate recalculations? How does it work with batch vs user updates

---
##  ✅ TODO section

## Rpadmin Overview
There are 2 main base classes: 
 - BaseJob
 - BaseEmployerJob

 Listed below are all classes that extend these 2 classes and marks the potential places we need to make changes.... Any one of these jobs can make an update to EmployeeElection, and any place we leave out could be a potential for a bug.

 Files marked as ❌ indicate a file that does not update or insert into EmployeeElections, while a ✔️ indicates that it inserts/updates into EmployeeELections and InputedIncome should be calculated

### Rate Recalculation
1. Identify where rate recalculations are performed.
2. Find any updates or references to EmployeeElections
3. Look for updates to `ImputedIncome` column, we need to make sure they get updated to EmployeeElection.


The RateRecalculateionJob overrides the BaseJob#executeJob method and calls the **sp_rate_recalc_batch** stored procedure. 
```java
@Override
	public void executeJob(final JobExecutionContext context, final JobRunDAO jobRunDAO, final JobRunBean jobRunBean, final StatusLogBean statusLogBean) {
		statusLogBean.logJobProgress("Rate Recalculation", 1, 0, jobRunBean.getStart(), true, "Recalculation");
		try {
            // call to sp_rate_recalc_batch
			ConnectionFactory.getInstance().getConnection().createStatement().execute("EXECUTE sp_rate_recalc_batch");
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			statusLogBean.addToRunLog("Error executing the Rate Recalculation stored procedure");
			ex.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
```
#### **sp_rate_recalc_batch**
The stored procedure is broken up by if statements depending on the **@rcd_update_type**. But for almost all update types,
there are some updates and insertion queries into the EmployeeElection table. 

```sql
while (select count(*) from #tmp_ui_calcs) > 0 begin

            set @calc_id = (select top 1 rcr_id from #tmp_ui_calcs order by rcr_id)

            if object_id('tempdb..#tmp_ui_orig_election') is not null drop table #tmp_ui_orig_election
            --Store off the original employee election
            select el.*
            into #tmp_ui_orig_election
            from #tmp_ui_calcs inner join employeeelections el on elect_id = rcr_electid
            where rcr_id = @calc_id

            -- Update the exisiting election record
            update employeeelections set elect_premium = rcr_elect_premium, elect_ee_prem = rcr_elect_ee_prem, elect_er_prem = rcr_elect_er_prem, elect_ee_payfreq_prem = rcr_elect_ee_payfreq_prem, elect_er_payfreq_prem = rcr_elect_er_payfreq_prem, elect_ee_pretax_payfreq_prem = isnull(rcr_elect_ee_pretax_payfreq_prem,0), elect_ee_pretax_prem = isnull(rcr_elect_ee_pretax_prem,0), elect_tax_status = rcr_elect_tax_status,elect_amount = case when plan_type = 3 then rcr_elect_amount else el.elect_amount end, elect_coverage_level = case when plan_type = 3 then rcr_elect_amount else el.elect_coverage_level end, elect_tran_date = getdate(),
            elect_excess_applied_prem = rcr_elect_excess_applied_prem, elect_excess_applied_payfreq_prem = rcr_elect_excess_applied_payfreq_prem , elect_excess_er_payfreq_prem = rcr_elect_excess_earned_payfreq_prem
            from #tmp_ui_orig_election te inner join employeeelections el on el.elect_id = te.elect_id and el.elect_eeid = te.elect_eeid
            inner join #tmp_ui_calcs tc on tc.rcr_electid = te.elect_id
            inner join plans on plan_id = el.elect_planid

            set @update_orig_el_cnt = @update_orig_el_cnt + @@rowcount
```

### Renewal
1. Identify where renewals are processed.
2. Add logic to calculate imputed income during renewal.
3. Update the `ImputedIncome` column with the calculated value.
4. Log the change in the audit trail.


#### RenewalWorker
**There are around 7 renewal worker classes that extend RenewalWorker, RenewalERBatch eventually gets a list of renewal workers to go through and calls the RenewalWorkder#renew**. We could implement a method in RenewalWorker and call it at the end of renew to make sure we cover all the renewal flows. These call the EmployeeElectionServer#saveElection (UESMiddleware)

** I did not chekck all the implementations of RenewarWorker, but the 3 I checked all used EmployeeElectionDAO (UESMiddleware) for update and insertions

### Dependent Age 
1. Identify where dependent age-out events are handled.
2. Add logic to calculate imputed income when a dependent ages out.
3. Update the `ImputedIncome` column with the calculated value.
4. Log the change in the audit trail.

#### 1. Dependent Age of Attainment ER
Looks like this just looks through the student list and sends notifications

#### 2. Dependent Term
Creates a DepTermERJob instance and calls the DepTermERJob#execute.

This job eventually calls USP_DenyDependentProcess and proc_usp_RemoveDependentFromCoverage, which has an insert into the EmployeeElection table

```
```
### Employee Aging (Life/Disability)
1. Identify where employee aging events are processed.
2. Add logic to calculate imputed income based on new age-based rates.
3. Update the `ImputedIncome` column with the calculated value.
4. Log the change in the audit trail.

### Spouse Aging (Life)
1. Identify where spouse aging events are handled.
2. Add logic to calculate imputed income based on new age-based rates.
3. Update the `ImputedIncome` column with the calculated value.
4. Log the change in the audit trail.

## 🧩 1. Event Definitions

| **Event**                  | **Trigger Condition**                                                                 |

| Employee Aging            | Employee reaches age bracket affecting Life/Disability rates                          |

## 🛠️ 3. System Requirements

- **New Column**: `ImputedIncome` (Decimal, currency format)
- **Trigger Points**: System must recalculate and update `ImputedIncome` when any of the 5 events occur.
- **Audit Trail**: Log changes with timestamp, event type, and previous value.
- **Validation**: Ensure age and coverage data are current before calculation.
